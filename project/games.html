                <h2>Sam & Max Games</h2>
                <p>Sam and Max has a considerable list of games in the adventure and puzzle genre with a lot of touches of humor, ranging from classic point and click, to improvements of the genre and finally a spin-off in virtual reality to experiment with new technologies. Hopefully more games are coming soon!</p>
